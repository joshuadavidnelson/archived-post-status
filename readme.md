## Description

This plugin allows you to archive your WordPress content.

WordPress supports a publishing workflow by marking content with a post status:
* 3 for pre-published states: _draft_, _pending_, and _future_. These are editable and pre-viewable, not yet ready for public view.
* 2 types of published statuses: _publish_ and _private_. These are viewable to the public or specific users.
* 1 non-published status: _trash_. Trashed content is not editable or viewable and [automatically deleted](https://codex.wordpress.org/Trash_status#Default_Days_before_Permanently_Deleted) after 30 days.

The one thing missing here is a status for content that is _viewable_ but **not** editable.

### Introducing the Archive

The 'archive' status marks content to a _post-published_ state, viewable to some but no longer edited. Examples might include:

* an out-of-date walkthrough
* a review of a discontinued product
* a rough draft replaced with a final version
* an old, time-specific post that is now irrelevant

Whatever the reason, incorporating the 'Archive' status can be a useful addition to your WordPress editing workflow.

* Unpublish your posts and pages without having to trash them
* Compatible with posts, pages, and public custom post types
* Ideal for sites where certain kinds of content is not meant to be evergreen
* Archive content is hidden from public view, only users with Editor or higher roles can see archived content.
